The little Jenkins Dashboard
========================

## How to use it

1. Edit the server/server.js file 

Replace 'http://WWW.MY-JENKINS.URL' with your jenkins Url (line 6).

You can too change the delay for the nodes and jobs updating (lines 152 and 153) in the same file.

2. Install meteor if not installed : (http://meteor.com)[see here]

3. Launch meteor with ``meteor``

 (The first time it installs npm-container so you'll have to relaunch it a second time.)

4. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3000, wait for the server updating and enjoy!
